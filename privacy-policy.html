  <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

  <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>

  <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>

  <h4>Sensitive Information</h4>
  <p>We do not process sensitive information.</p>

  <h4>Payment Data</h4>
  <p>We may collect data necessary to process your payment if you choose to make purchases, such as your payment instrument number, and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is handled and stored by Google Play. <p>You may find their privacy policy link(s) here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Privacy &amp; Terms – Google</a>.</p>

  <p>This app is developed and maintained by an individual creator. While legal requirements such as contact information and opt-out notices are presented, we are unable to provide individual support or respond to personal inquiries. All AI-driven insights are generated without storing or linking any personally identifiable information. Users may provide emotional input or responses, which are processed locally or anonymously to deliver AI insights, but are not stored or associated with any user identity.</p>

  <h4>Application Data</h4>
  <p>If you use our application(s), we also may collect the following information if you choose to provide us with access or permission:</p>

  <h5>Mobile Device Data</h5>
  <p>We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, version information and system configuration information, device and application identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If you are using our application(s), we may also collect information about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your mobile device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, and information about the features of our application(s) you accessed.</p>

  <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

  <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

  <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</p>

  <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

  <p><strong>The information we collect includes:</strong></p>
  <h4>Log and Usage Data</h4>
  <p>Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</p>

  <h4>Device Data</h4>
  <p>We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</p>

  <h4>Location Data</h4>
  <p>We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</p>

  <h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p>

  <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.</strong> We may process your information to provide you with the requested service. We may process emotional inputs provided by users in order to deliver AI-generated insights, without linking this data to any identifiable individual.</li>

  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section" id="section3">
  <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

  <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
  <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users, diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities, and understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience. We may also process anonymous emotional inputs and usage trends to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
  <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent).</p>

  <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
    <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section4">
  <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following categories of third parties.</p>

  <h4>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers</h4>
  <p>We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.</p>

  <p>The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Analytics Services</li>

</div>

<div class="section" id="section5">
  <h2>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>

  <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>

  <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>

  <p><strong>As of now, our application does not serve advertisements and does not use marketing cookies or targeted advertising technologies.</strong></p>

  <p>To the extent that online tracking technologies are considered a "sale" or "sharing" under applicable US state laws, users may opt out by submitting a privacy request via our <a href="https://forms.gle/SvGn15i81Zt4BLmC9" target="_blank">privacy request form</a> or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@soruvalab.com">support@soruvalab.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: 
    <a href="https://soruva.github.io/legal-docs/cookie-policy.html" target="_blank">https://legal.soruvalab.com/cookie-policy.html</a>.

  <h2>6. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.</p>

  <p>As part of our Services, we offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, "AI Products").

  <h4>Our AI Products</h4>

<div class="section" id="section7">
  <h2>7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>

  <p>Our servers are located in the United States, Ireland, Germany, Singapore and Japan. These locations reflect our current use of services like Google Firebase and Cloudflare, which host and operate parts of our infrastructure. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, Ireland, Germany, Singapore and Japan, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored by, and processed by us in our facilities and in the facilities of the third parties with whom we may share your personal information, including in the United States, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Japan, and other countries as described earlier in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

  <h4>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses</h4>
  <p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="section8">
  <h2>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>

  <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this Notice will require us to retain your personal information longer than necessary.</p>

  <p>We retain user data only as needed to support core functionality such as analytics and app performance. Most data is anonymized and stored only in aggregate form. No personally identifiable information is stored.</p>

  <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section9">
  <h2>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

  <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>

  <p>Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. Zenofii is designed as an anonymous experience and does not request your name, contact details, or any personally identifiable information.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="section10">
  <h2>10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

  <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@soruvalab.com">support@soruvalab.com</a>.</p>

  <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information, and our app is designed to be used anonymously, with no names or contact details requested. Zenofii is designed for users aged 13 and older.

</div>

<div class="section" id="section11">
  <h2>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
  <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence. Please note that Zenofii does not require user registration, and no user accounts are created or maintained. Therefore, the privacy rights mentioned here are generally applicable to device-level data interactions, since no user-specific accounts or registrations are maintained by Zenofii.</p>

  <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us via the email address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

  <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>

  <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>

  <h4>Withdrawing your consent</h4>
  <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us via the email address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

  <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:support@soruvalab.com">support@soruvalab.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section12">
  <h2>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
